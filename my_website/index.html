            <h3> My Background </h3>
            <p> Hey!  For nearly a decade, I have been in academia, studying philosophy.  I'm currently finishing up a PdD in philosophy at University of Virginia.  I spend a lot of time writing about complicated problems. I also teach.  I'm usually a teaching assistant, which involves teaching small sections weekly and meeting with students one on one. But I've also developed a course from scratch and taught it.  That is one of my proudest accomplishments!  I've been a TA for logic a few times, and have always enjoyed it. That's what drew me to software engineering. Logic is great, and I want to keep using it! </p>
            <p> This is my <a href = "./cv.pdf">CV</a>. </p>
            <p> This is an <a href = "https://news.virginia.edu/content/thinking-about-outside-box">article</a> about the course I developed. </p>
          </section>
          <section id = "hobbies">
            <h3> My hobbies </h3>
            <p> In addition to philosphy and learning to code, I sing in the Oratorio Society of Virginia.  That's one of the coolest things I'm doing right now!  I also like to read (or listen to audiobooks), try out new recipes, and play games with friends.  I also have a cat named Lucky.  I serve him at his pleasure. </p>
